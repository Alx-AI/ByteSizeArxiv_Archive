Symbol Spotting on Digital Architectural Floor Plans Using a Deep
  Learning based Framework
#####
This papers focuses on symbol spotting on real world digital architectural
floor plans with a deep learning  based framework. Traditional on the fly
symbol spotting methods are unable to address the semantic challenge of
graphical notation variability  i.e. low intra class symbol similarity  an
issue that is particularly important in architectural floor plan analysis. The
presence of occlusion and clutter  characteristic of real world plans  along
with a varying graphical symbol complexity from almost trivial to highly
complex  also pose challenges to existing spotting methods. In this paper  we
address all of the above issues by leveraging recent advances in DL and
adapting an object detection framework based on the You Only Look Once 
architecture. We propose a training strategy based on tiles  avoiding many
issues particular to DL based object detection networks related to the relative
small size of symbols compared to entire floor plans  aspect ratios  and data
augmentation. Experiments on real world floor plans demonstrate that our method
successfully detects architectural symbols with low intra class similarity and
of variable graphical complexity  even in the presence of heavy occlusion and
clutter. Additional experiments on the public SESYD dataset confirm that our
proposed approach can deal with various degradation and noise levels and
outperforms other symbol spotting methods.
