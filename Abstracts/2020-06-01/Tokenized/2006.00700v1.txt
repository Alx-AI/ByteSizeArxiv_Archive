When Machine Learning Meets Multiscale Modeling in Chemical Reactions
#####
Due to the intrinsic complexity and nonlinearity of chemical reactions
direct applications of traditional machine learning algorithms may face with
many difficulties . In this study through two concrete examples with biological
background we illustrate how the key ideas of multiscale modeling can help to
reduce the computational cost of machine learning a lot as well as how machine
learning algorithms perform model reduction automatically in a time scale
separated system . Our study highlights the necessity and effectiveness of an
integration of machine learning algorithms and multiscale modeling during the
study of chemical reactions .
