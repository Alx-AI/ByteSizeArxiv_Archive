Heart Rate Estimation from Face Videos for Student Assessment
Experiments on edBB
#####
In this study we estimate the heart rate from face videos for student
assessment . This information could be very valuable to track their status along
time and also to estimate other data such as their attention level or the
presence of stress that may be caused by cheating attempts . The recent
edBBplat a platform for student behavior modelling in remote education is
considered in this study . This platform permits to capture several signals
from a set of sensors that capture biometric and behavioral data RGB and near
infrared cameras microphone EEG band mouse smartwatch and keyboard among
others . In the experimental framework of this study we focus on the RGB and
near infrared video sequences for performing heart rate estimation applying
remote photoplethysmography techniques . The experiments include behavioral and
physiological data from different students completing a collection of tasks
related to e learning . Our proposed face heart rate estimation approach is
compared with the heart rate provided by the smartwatch achieving very
promising results for its future deployment in e learning applications .
